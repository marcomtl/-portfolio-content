                For this page I decided to focus on my favorite tv sitcoms. These shows brought me back to my childhood and shows that I grew up watching. These shows give me memorabilia and that’s why they all are special to me. Again I recommend all of these shows to anyone on this site who enjoys watching comedy. The only issue is that some of these shows are discontinued and old, while others are still being released until this day.             </p>

                These shows are typically more family friendly than series. They are also much easier to watch since they are only about 20 to 30 minutes long. I’ve incorporated a mixture of cartoon and reality sitcoms. Shows like Family Guy, Cleveland Show, and American Dad have the same creators; this is similar to how Power and BMF both came from the same producer. If a creator makes one thing I like, chances are I will find another art of theirs that I enjoy. Shows like Martin and George Lopez are sitcoms that are based around a fictional life of the show’s creator. The shows I particularly enjoyed because I was familiar with the lead actors in movies and I found them to be genuinely funny.             </p>
